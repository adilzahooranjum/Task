Task: Develop a Google Automotive Services (GAS) Integration Module for an Android Automotive App
Objective: You are required to create a module for an Android Automotive application that integrates Google Automotive Services (GAS) to provide real-time navigation and media services. The goal of this task is to assess your ability to work with Android Automotive OS, Google Automotive Services, and advanced Java programming.
Task Description:
1. Setup: - Create a new Android Automotive project or use an existing project template that targets Android Automotive OS. - Ensure that the project is configured to use the latest Android Automotive libraries and APIs.
2. Navigation Service Integration: - Implement a feature that utilizes the Google Maps API for real-time navigation. - The app should display a map view that shows the current location of the vehicle. - Integrate turn-by-turn navigation using Googleâ€™s Directions API. - The app should handle user input for destination search, either via voice command or text input.
3. Media Service Integration: - Integrate Google Automotive Media services to allow the user to browse and play music from a Google-approved media provider (e.g., Spotify). - Implement a UI that shows media controls (play, pause, next, previous) and album artwork. - Ensure that the app complies with Android Automotive media UX guidelines.
4. Voice Interaction: - Implement voice command functionality using Google Assistant to control both the navigation and media features. - The app should be able to respond to basic voice commands such as "Play music," "Pause music," "Navigate to [destination]."
5. Test & Deployment: - Test the application on an Android Automotive emulator. - Provide a brief document detailing the setup and usage instructions for the emulator
environment. - Ensure the application follows best practices for performance, security, and user experience in the automotive environment.
6. Bonus: - Implement offline navigation capability, where the app can cache map data and continue navigation even without an active internet connection. - Integrate real-time traffic data to adjust routes based on current traffic conditions.
Deliverables: - The source code of the Android Automotive application, well-structured and documented. - A brief README file that explains the architecture, features, and how to set up the project locally. - A video or set of screenshots demonstrating the app running on an Android Automotive emulator.
Evaluation Criteria: - Code Quality: Adherence to coding standards, clarity, and use of best practices in Java development. - Functionality: Completeness of the navigation and media services integration. - UI/UX: Compliance with Android Automotive design guidelines, and the overall user experience. - Performance: Efficient use of resources and smooth operation of the app on the emulator. - Documentation: Clarity and thoroughness of the provided documentation.
